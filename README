This package contains two command line tool programs -- the namesake
'cprec' and dd-dvd (the latter can be disabled by configure
option --disable-dd-dvd) -- and a graphical front-end wxDVDBackup.
These tools are helpers for making a backup of DVD video.

The cprec and dd-dvd tools should be useful to those accustomed to
working at the command line and developing their own procedures
for accomplishing a task.  Manual pages cprec(1) and dd-dvd(1)
are installed.

The front-end wxDVDBackup should be easy and convenient to use,
particularly for those willing to spend a few moments examining the
interface.  There are several detailed ``tool-tips''.

Both cprec and dd-dvd depend on a library called libdvdread, but
libdvdread is not a prerequisite to build and install the programs,
because by default the programs attempt to load libdvdread and its
symbols at runtime. See INSTALL.

The front-end wxDVDBackup is written in python and uses wxPython,
plus some other useful tools. See INSTALL.
