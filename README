# (WX) M A/V (Player)

## AKA wxmav

__(WX) M A/V (Player)__ is the fancy name of the program.
The familiar name is simply __wxmav__ (and the _installed_ name
is __wxmav.pyw__ on _MSWindows_ and just __wxmav.py__ elsewhere).
The friendly familiar name will be used here.

wxmav is a player for audio or visual media in common formats.
The ‘wx’ [or ‘(WX)’] part just means that the program uses the
__wxWidgets__ library.  Don’t worry if you don’t know what that is,
using the program does not require you to know.  You can think of
the ‘wx’ like the “Sweet” in _Sweet Jane_ or the “Weird” in
_Weird Al_.
